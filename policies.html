    <h1>Freelance Policies</h1>
    <p>These policies apply to commissioned freelance projects and are separate from my game development work showcased on this site. I consider my freelance work side work. If I am actively developing games, I will not be accepting commissions. I will indicate on the website if I am currently accepting commissions.</p>

    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>Refunds are not available for digital products (e.g., logos, digital assets) once delivered and explicitly approved by the client via email or written confirmation.</p>
    <p>I prioritize revising and iterating on deliverables (up to 10 rounds) to ensure client satisfaction before final approval. Rounds go quickly, but delays in client feedback can extend project time.</p>
    <p>Once the client approves the final deliverables, the project is considered complete. Changes requested after final approval will require a new agreement and additional fees, to be negotiated based on the scope of changes.</p>

    <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <p>Either party may cancel the project with 48 hoursâ€™ written notice (via email to cursedguneal@gmail.com) from the date of signing the freelance agreement.</p>
    <p>If the client cancels within 48 hours of signing, the 25% deposit paid upon signing will be retained by me as compensation for time spent organizing, planning, and starting work (e.g., initial sketches or asset prep), including any iterations or revisions provided. The client will not owe the remaining 75% of the total fee.</p>
    <p>If the client cancels after 48 hours, an additional 25% cancellation fee applies, bringing the total to 50% of the fee, or a higher percentage based on project milestones (e.g., 25% after 1 week, 50% after 2 weeks) to reflect work completed.</p>
    <p>In the event of cancellation by the client (whether within or after 48 hours), the client will receive no deliverables and will have no rights to use any iterations, revisions, or work provided by me.</p>
    <p>If I cancel at any time due to unforeseen circumstances, the 25% deposit will be refunded in full, and the client will owe no further payments.</p>

    <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
    <p>All work is commissioned under a freelance agreement.</p>
    <p>A 25% deposit is due upon signing the freelance agreement, with the remaining 75% due within 7 days of project completion (upon delivery of final files) via Stripe invoice.</p>
    <p>Late payments will incur a 5% fee per week, starting 7 days after the due date.</p>

    <h2>Project Timeline</h2>
    <p>Projects are typically completed within 2-4 weeks but are not expected to exceed 42 days (6 weeks) from the start date of the project.</p>
    <p>Project duration may vary depending on the scope and the time taken by the client to provide feedback (due within 7 days of receiving deliverables).</p>
    <p>Longer projects, such as those requiring extensive revisions or larger deliverables, may take more time and will incur a larger total fee, to be determined based on the project scope and agreed upon in writing.</p>
