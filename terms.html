    <p><strong>Last Updated: April 1, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome to guneal.github.io (the "Website"), operated by Guneal ("Guneal," "we," "us," or "our").

    <p>Except as outlined in Section 2, you may not reproduce, distribute, modify, display, or create derivative works of any Content without our prior written permission. Unauthorized use, including using Content to train AI models or reverse-engineer game assets, is prohibited and may lead to legal action.</p>
    <p>Client-commissioned work (e.g., custom game designs or artwork) is governed by separate agreements, which will specify ownership and usage rights.</p>
