            <h3>Refunds</h3>
            <p>Refunds are not available for digital products (e.g., logos, digital assets) once delivered and approved by the client.</p>
            <p>The artist prioritizes revising and iterating on the deliverables to ensure client satisfaction before final approval.</p>
            <p>Once the client approves the final deliverables, the project is considered complete. Changes requested after final approval will require a new agreement and additional fees.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="policy">
            <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
            <p>Either party may cancel the project with 48 hours’ written notice from the date of signing the freelance agreement.</p>
            <p>If the client cancels within 48 hours of signing, the 25% deposit paid upon signing will be retained by the artist as compensation for time spent organizing, planning, and starting work, including any iterations or revisions provided. The client will not owe the remaining 75% of the total fee.</p>
            <p>If the client cancels after 48 hours from the date of signing, an additional cancellation fee of 25% of the total agreed rate will apply, bringing the total amount retained by the artist to 50% of the total fee. This fee covers the artist’s time and effort invested in the project.</p>
            <p>In the event of cancellation by the client (whether within or after 48 hours), the client will receive no deliverables and will have no rights to use any iterations, revisions, or work provided by the artist.</p>
            <p>If the artist cancels at any time, the 25% deposit paid by the client will be refunded in full, and the client will owe no further payments.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="policy">
            <h3>Payment Terms</h3>
            <p>All work is commissioned under a freelance agreement.</p>

            <p>Late payments will incur a 5% fee per week.</p>

            <h3>Project Timeline</h3>

            <p>Project duration may vary depending on the scope of the project and the time taken by the client to provide feedback.</p>
            <p>Longer projects, such as those requiring extensive revisions or larger deliverables, may take more time and will incur a larger total fee, to be determined based on the project scope.</p>
